    "# Using surface roughness to date landslides\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In March of 2014, unusually high rainfall totals over a period of several weeks triggered a deep-seated landslide that mobilized into a rapidly moving debris flow. The debris flow inundated the town of Oso, Washington, resulting in 43 fatalities and the destruction of 49 houses. Other landslide deposits are visible in the vicinity of the 2014 Oso landslide (see figure below). The goal of this assignment is to estimate the ages of the nearby landslide deposits so that we can say something about the recurrence interval of large, deep-seated landslides in this area. Do they happen roughly every 100 years, 5000 years, or do they only happen once every 100,000 years?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"OsoOverviewMap.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy will be to take advantage of the fact that recent landslides have “rougher” surfaces. Creep and bioturbation smooth the landslide deposits over time in a way that we can predict (using the diffusion equation!). We will use the standard linear diffusion model, shown below, to simulate how the surface of a landslide deposit will change with time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}=D\\frac{\\partial^2z}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $z$ denotes elevation, $x$ is distance in the horizontal direction, and $D$ is the colluvial transport coefficient. Recall, that in a previous exercise we estimated the value of $D$ within the San Francisco Volcanic Field (SFVF) in northern Arizona. We found that $D\\approx5$ $\\mathrm{m^2}$ $\\mathrm{kyr}^{-1}$ in the SFVF. In this exercise, we will use a larger value of $D=10$ $\\mathrm{m^2}$ $\\mathrm{kyr}^{-1}$ since our study site near Oso, Washington, is in a wetter climate with more vegetation (and therefore greater rates of bioturbation). Once we have a model that lets us determine how the surface of a landslide deposit will change with time, we may be able to use it to describe how surface roughness varies with age."

    "\n",
    "If we are ultimately going to use surface roughness to date landslide deposits (i.e. older deposits are less rough, younger deposits are more rought), we first need a way to quantify what we mean by \"roughness\". One way to quantify surface roughness is to extract a transect from the slope data and compute the standard deviation of the slope along that transect. That is what we do here; we compute the standard deviation of the slope (SDS) over each 30-meter interval along a transect and then take the mean of all of these standard deviations to arrive at an estimate of roughness for each landslide deposit that we are interested in dating. The plots below show slope (deg) along transects that run over the 2014 Oso Landslide and the nearby Rowan Landslide (unknown age). Note that the Rowan landslide looks slightly less “rough” and therefore has a lower SDS value associated with it.\n",

    "### Estimating the Age of the Rowan Landslide\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now estimate the age of the Rowan Landslide using the diffusion model. This is the same model we used to simulate how cinder cones evolve. Since the same processes (creep, bioturbation) are driving sediment transport on landslide deposits, we can apply the same model here. However, when we modeled cinder cones we knew what the initial condition looked like. All cinder cones start with cone shape that is characterized by hillslope angles that are roughly equal to the angle of repose for granular material ($\\approx 30^{\\circ}$). We do not know what each of these landslide deposits looked like when they were first created. So, we will assume that all landslide deposits (including the Rowan Landslide) looked like the Oso Landslide immediately after they were emplaced. Of course, no two landslide deposits ever look exactly the same but it is reasonable to assume that the statistical properties of the initial landslide deposits (i.e. roughness) are similar to each other. We will make this assumption and simulate how the roughness, as quantified using the SDS, of the Oso Landslide deposit will change over time. If we know the relationship between SDS and deposit age, then we can estimate the age of any landside deposit in this region simply by computing its SDS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by using the model to estimate how much the Oso Landslide deposit will change after it is subjected to erosion via diffusive processes (e.g. bioturbation, rain splash, freeze-thaw) for 100 years. The code below is set up to run the diffusion model using a topographic transect through the Oso Landslide as the initial topography. All you need to do is assign realistic values for the colluvial transport coefficient (landscape diffusivity) and choose an age. Use a value of $D=10$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$ $\\mathrm{kyr}^{-1}$ for the colluvial transport coefficient and an age of 0.1 kyr (since we want to know what the deposit will look like when the Oso Landslide is 100 years old).

    "You should see that the SDS value for the topography (shown on the plot) after 0.1 kyr of erosion is slightly smaller than the SDS value of the initial landslide surface (e.g. the SDS value of the Oso Landslide deposit). This is a result of the fact that diffusive processes smooth the surface over time, but 0.1 kyr is not a sufficient amount of time to substantially *smooth* the surface of the landslide deposit. Although the SDS value has decreased over a time period of 0.1 kyr, it is still larger than the SDS value that we have computed for the Rowan Landslide deposit. Therefore, the Rowan Landslide deposit must be older than 0.1 kyr. Continue to run the model using the code cell above with increasing values for the age until you find an age that gives you a SDS value that is close to the one computed for the Rowan Landslide ($SDS\\approx5.2$).

Since we are not doing a rigorous analsysis of recurrence intervals, you do not need to do any calculations (other than those needed to answer the three questions above). In the space below, include a parapgraph of text (3-5 sentences) in which you answer this question and provide some justification for your reasoning. Your justificaiton could include (but does not have to) some discussion about the limitations of the above analysis."
